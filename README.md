# AchillesTendon

Code for A Computational Pipeline for the Analysis of Wearable Sensor Data for Achilles Tendinopathy.  All code is structured as python notebooks that can be recreated with the data used in the study.
John Drazan is the owner of all data used in this study: jdrazan@fairfield.edu

Each jupyter notebook represents the steps taken to generate the models for each scenario. LSTM, SVM, and Random Forest (RF) notebooks are in their corresponding folder, with one script each for our 3-class, 6-class and 18-class scenarios.

The code used for the preliminary step of step parsing from the original data can be found at analysis ML manuscript updated2.ipynb
